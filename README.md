# Contract-Data-Analysis

**Overview**
This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for analyzing contract data obtained from the System for Award Management (SAM.gov). SAM.gov is the official website of the U.S. Government, providing detailed information on awarded contracts using data directly from the Federal Data Procurement System (FPDS). The provided data covers the last four fiscal years (FY20, FY21, FY22, and FY23).

**Data Sources**
The raw data files for each fiscal year are available for download from the following locations:

FY23:[ Download Link]( https://umbc.box.com/shared/static/au8h309qptksq5wlem6g5onn5v13fsrc.csv)
FY22:[ Download Link](https://umbc.box.com/shared/static/tdkmuj86qm2uxhvjlfkav2i3pnx9fkoa.csv)
FY21: [Download Link](https://umbc.box.com/shared/static/7emabgf9ck2afprmrl459jnk30ewmabj.csv)
FY20: [Download Link](https://umbc.box.com/shared/static/91lmieun5u1e8p87wmlnuglyzl3xm91h.csv)
Additionally, a data dictionary describing the fields in the dataset is available here.


**Setup and Environment**
To get started with the analysis, it is recommended to use Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. You can access the Colab notebook here.


**Analysis Goals**
The analysis aims to explore various aspects of the contract data and test hypotheses related to government contracts. Some initial hypotheses to be explored include:


**Hypothesis**: Census Bureau has the largest number of contracts in the Department of Commerce.
Department of Defense Contract Trends:


**Hypothesis:** Department of Defense posted the highest number of contracts over the last several years comparing with other departments.
Consistency in Census Bureau Contracts:


**Hypothesis:** Over the last several years, Census Bureau posted the same number of contracts.
Growth in Department of Commerce Contracts:


**Hypothesis:** There is an increase in the number of contracts posted for the Department of Commerce over the last several years.
Notebooks
The analysis will be conducted using Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook will focus on specific aspects of the data and hypotheses testing.
